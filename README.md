### Todos:

- Improve dataset and implement providerRoutes3

### Instructions for Local Testing/Deploying:

- Basic Setup:
  - Must make your own dev.js file within the config directory and follow prod.js for what keys you must fill in
  - Go to mLab.com for a Mongo database that you can set up. This requires you making a user with a username and password to fill in the URI
  - `npm install` for all the packages

- Deployment:
  - Set up environment variables, mimicking the style within prod.js
  - Use the keywords after process.env within prod.js to set the names and then enter the values you want

- User Setup:
  - This requires the use of a google developer account.
  - Setup a new project with whatever name you would like to call it. The location doesn't really matter, either (I hope!).
  - Use the Google+ API and set up credentials, including authorized URLs if need be (this is for deployment when ready; the relevant URLs should be given by your deployment service)
  - Set up a OAuth Client ID, including authorized URLs and callback paths (this is needed for both local testing and deployment)
